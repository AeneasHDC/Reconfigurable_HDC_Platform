      <h1 class="title">AeneasHDC FAQ:</h1>
        <span style="color: #ffff00cc">What is AeneasHDC?</span> AeneasHDC is the first automatic open-source framework in the literature to facilitate the generation of flexible hardware accelerators for hyperdimensional computing (HDC) learning problems.
        The environment is extremely customizable, supporting a wide range of the most common techniques adopted in the literature for learning models, enabling users to easily assess the impact of
        different design choices on model accuracy, memory usage, execution time, energy consumption, and area requirements.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color: #ffff00cc">What is the purpose of AeneasHDC?</span> The main goal of AeneasHDC is to provide a complete and automatic environment to generate <b>flexible</b>hardware accelerators for HDC learning problems,
          allowing the user to easily explor the impact of different design choices on model performance as well as hardware requirements.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color: #ffff00cc">How to use AeneasHDC?</span> The intuitive AeneasHDC's GUI allows users to define the specifics
          of the problem, such as dataset characteristics, the desired programming language, the target FPGA
          device and the model details. It also allows to distribute tasks between
          software and hardware implementations, allowing for flexible
          customization of the hardware accelerator. The desired model is automatically instantiated and evaluated both in software and hardware and 
          all the report data are made available in PDF. From the home page, click on the
          <i>"Configure Your Model"</i> button to open the configuration page, and adjust your model's parameters.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color: #ffff00cc">Can I use the environment without GUI?</span> Sure, all the software and hardware libraries of AeneasHDC are 
          open-source and completely free. You can just import the required class and use the model how u prefer. You can find all the infos in the AeneasHDC PDF manual.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color: #ffff00cc">I dont know how to use AeneasHDC</span> You can find a complete tutorial in the tutorial section of the platform. Additionally, 
            you can find the detailed how-to-use manual on GitHub. For any other question, you can contact the support team.
          <br><br>
          <span style="color: #ffff00cc">I can not find the desired learning task or technique in AeneasHDC</span> The AeneasHDC environment is always in evolution and we are constantly adding new models and techniques.
           However, the model is open-source, so you can easily extend the software and hardware libraries to include the desired model. You can find the detailed how-to-use manual on GitHub.
           We always encourage community collaboration to enhance and evolve the framework over time. If you have any questions or need help, please contact the support team.
