    "description": "The Hepta dataset represents seven very separate 3D clouds, one with a considerable larger density than the others. The Hepta dataset consists of six classes with n = 30 points each, drawn uniform from the unit cube centered at the 3 points on the axes. The seventh class consists of n = 32 points drawn uniform-independent and identically distributed from a sphere of radius 0.15 centered at the origin.",
