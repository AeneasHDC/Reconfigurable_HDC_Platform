## 🗺️ Model Overview
AeneasHDC is the first automatic open-source framework in the literature to facilitate the generation of flexible hardware accelerators for hyperdimensional computing (HDC) learning problems.
The environment is extremely customizable, supporting a wide range of the most common techniques adopted in the literature for learning models, enabling users to easily assess the impact of
different design choices on model accuracy, memory usage, execution time, energy consumption, and area requirements.
    
The Figure below illustrates the AeneasHDC's workflow. The intuitive <a href="#-gui" style="font-weight: bold;">Graphic User Interface (GUI)</a> allows the user to specify the problem characteristics, including dataset details, the number of features and classes, the desired programming language, and the target FPGA. An interactive mechanism lets the user decide how to distribute the workload between the software and the hardware implementations. The hardware can be generated to accelerate the entire classification process (train, inference, retrain) or just some tasks, deciding, for example, to execute the train and retrain in software and instantiate only the hardware for the inference, as commonly done for embedded applications.

  <img src="./doc/img/theory/aeneas_model_nobg_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only" alt="Dark Mode Image" width="600">
</p>
The system automatically generates all the configuration files required by the following entities and instantiates the model in software and hardware. 
Thanks to the versatile AeneasHDC library, the software model can be produced in Python, Matlab, or C++. The model is executed, and the results in terms of accuracy and other performance metrics are collected. The data required for inference are extracted and passed to the hardware model.
    
The hardware architecture is generated using the Xilinx Vitis High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool and then synthesized, simulated and tested using Vivado 2023. The data about energy consumption, execution time and resource allocation are collected from the design.
    
All the results obtained from the software and the hardware implementations are finally relayed to a dedicated report-generation module that compiles a comprehensive HTML-based summary, encapsulating all the information from the run simulations. The summary includes details of the model configuration, dataset specifications, chosen programming language, target hardware platform, and key performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, energy consumption, and resource utilization.
This report is stored locally and can be readily accessible through the user-friendly GUI, which organizes all conducted tests and allows to review and compare different runs. 

The entire process is engineered to be fully automated, abstracting complex or time-consuming tasks associated with coding models or designing custom hardware architectures. The GUI is an efficient singular point of control that enables users to manage the model at every stage. However, AeneasHDC is completely open-source and makes all its libraries and scripts accessible. <a href="#-documentation">Extensive documentation</a> is provided, covering the basic usage of the model, the theoretical concepts behind parameter selections, and detailed insights into the underlying code and library functions.
    
The AeneasHDC environment is always in evolution and we are constantly adding new models and techniques, aiming to keep up with all the innovations in the literature
However, the model is completely open-source, and the user can easily extend the software and hardware libraries to include new desired models. The detailed how-to-use manual is on GitHub.
We always encourage community <a href="#-contribution">collaboration</a> to enhance and evolve the framework over time. If you have any questions or need help, please <a href="#-contact">contact</a> the support team.

## 🚀 Graphic User Interface (GUI)
The Aeneas HyperCompute Platform offers a robust, user-friendly interface designed to simplify the deployment of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) models across both software and hardware environments. The platform is built to accommodate researchers and developers looking to rapidly prototype and deploy flexible HDC systems in hardware.

#### Landing Page
The landing page presents a clean and minimalistic design, centered around easy navigation to all the platform's features. Users are greeted with an overview of the platform’s capabilities and an inviting "Dive In!" button to start their project configuration immediately.

</p>

#### Configuration Dashboard
The Configuration Dashboard serves as the central hub where users can define the specifics of their HDC model. The dashboard allows users to configure:

- Dataset characteristics
- Learning task
- Desired design choices for the HDC model
- Software implementation language choices (Python, Matlab, C++)
- Target FPGA
- Selection of the target learning phase for hardware acceleration (train, inference, retrain, all)
- Desired hardware parallelism

The intuitive layout ensures all settings are accessible in a logical, streamlined manner, facilitating a seamless configuration process.
For more granular control over the configuration settings, modal windows provide detailed options for each component of the HDC model.

</p>

#### Execution and Reporting Interface
Once the model is configured, a Jupyter notebook is created, including all the functions to compile and execute the specified model in software and hardware. These notebooks also provide a detailed log of the execution, including performance metrics and operational logs, facilitating debugging and performance optimization.

</p>

#### Project and Report Management
The platform includes a project dashboard for managing multiple HDC projects, offering options to open, rename, copy, or delete projects. Additionally, a dedicated reporting interface compiles and displays performance metrics and other crucial data from each run, enhancing transparency and traceability.

<details id="abstract">
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a bio-inspired learning paradigm, that models neural pattern activities using high-dimensional distributed representations.
  HDC leverages parallel and simple vector arithmetic operations to combine and compare different concepts, enabling cognitive and reasoning tasks. 
  The computational efficiency and parallelism of this approach make it particularly suited for hardware implementations, especially as a lightweight, energy-efficient solution for performing learning tasks on resource-constrained edge devices. The HDC pipeline, including encoding, training, and comparison stages, has been extensively explored with various approaches in the literature. However, while these techniques are mainly oriented to improve the model accuracy, their influence on hardware parameters remains largely unexplored. This work presents AeneasHDC, an automatic and open-source platform for the streamlined deployment of HDC models in both software and hardware for classification, regression and clustering tasks. AeneasHDC supports an extensive range of techniques commonly adopted in literature, automates the design of flexible hardware accelerators for HDC, and empowers users to easily assess the impact of different design choices on model accuracy, memory usage, execution time, power consumption, and area requirements.
